With Magoosh, they don't have to. Our mission is simple: create products that give students <em>everywhere</em> access to enjoyable, affordable, and quality test prep. We help millions study at their own pace, on their own time regardless of location, social status, or background. Our team is driven to create the best content and study tools because we're out to change the test prep experience for all.</p> <p>Magoosh started in 2009 with four co-founders and a few computers. Today, we're a growing team of 22 in-office employees, with products that are used all over the world in more than 180 countries. Millions have studied with us, downloaded our apps, and watched our videos. And every day, we work with thousands of students to help them get the scores they need to get into the schools they want.</p> <p>If you're a friendly, passionate, lifelong learner who's looking to make a real difference in students' lives, we want you to help us change the test prep world.</p> <p>Check out our values <a href=""http://magoosh.com/blog/magoosh-core-values/"">here</a>!</p> <h3><strong>About the Job</strong></h3> <p>We're looking for a Software Engineer. You'll help us improve our products, shape engineering process, and grow our small but impactful engineering team. We're a 25+ person company with 3 engineers, so you'll have a lot of autonomy and responsibility.   </p> <p>We've accomplished a lot with a little: we have over 2 million students using our free products, hundreds of thousands who have paid, and revenue well into the millions. Rather than pursuing hyper growth at all costs, we've built a profitable and growing company where we truly care about our employees and our students. We've turned test prep from a necessary evil into an <a href=""http://gre.magoosh.com/testimonials/2426"">enjoyable experience</a> at an <a href=""http://gre.magoosh.com/testimonials/2882"">affordable price</a>.</p> <h3><strong>About Engineering at Magoosh</strong></h3> <p>You'll work on all parts of our stack. So far we use Rails (the core of our application); PhoneGap + AngularJS (for some mobile apps); and ReactNative (for newer mobile apps). We're hosted on AWS, and you'll do a little bit of dev ops to make sure things keep running smoothly. We love previous experience with any of these, though we care more about the quality of your engineering than the languages you know.</p> <p>We build and ship new features quickly and deploy multiple times a day, but don't have many tests (maybe we should add more?). We work together to prioritize which bugs and features to work on, but don't try to build or fix everything, focusing on the most important problems. We work closely with non-engineers on the product team and other Magooshers, but we don't receive product requirements documents or create high-fidelity mockups. We all work together to iterate on product designs, as we don't have any dedicated designers. We're generally in the office from 9-10am to 6-7pm or so and sometimes work from home on evenings and weekends, if inspired or there's a need.</p> <p>This position is based in the Magoosh office in Berkeley, CA.

1006,Application Software Engineer,"<div>Our mission at Kitty Hawk is to make the dream of personal flight a reality. We believe when everyone has access to personal flight, a new, limitless world of opportunity will open up to them.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>For years, our team members have dedicated themselves to inventing world-changing technologies. We've learned that to create something that the world has never seen, we have to set aside convention and re-imagine everything. That spirit of innovation led us to design and build cars that drive themselves, a human-powered helicopter, an operational airplane with flapping wings, and the fastest bicycle on earth.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We are looking for an Application Software Engineer. As a member of Kitty Hawk/Zee Aero's R&amp;D team, you will work on building software systems that are useful and enjoyable for owners and operators of our various vehicles. You will build applications to help internal customers (e.g. engineers, flight test) visualize data and understand and improve vehicle performance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You should enjoy working with customers to frequently ship new software that meets their needs. You don't have an ego, and are passionate about doing whatever it takes to deliver value. You are a team player: we avoid single points of failure in our code and on our teams. We like to ship early and often, and learn and iterate as we go.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We are doing something that's never been done before, so, you'll be energetic, adaptable and a fast learner who can make sound engineering judgments with limited information. You will make substantial contributions to the customer experience for our new aircraft types.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As part of the interview process, you should be able to describe technical contributions that you are most proud of, and effectively convey to the team a relevant topic that is of interest to you.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You ideally match the below criteria. However, what is most important is a stated track record and passion for learning. Meeting all of the below criteria is desired, but not mandatory:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><strong>Requirements</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&bull; Experience building backends for production (24x7) applications.</div>
<div>&bull; Experience and passionate about visualizing and understanding data.</div>
<div>&bull; Proficient/expert in at least one statically typed language (C/C++, Java, Go, etc)</div>
<div>&bull; Proficient with in-browser development (JS, web frameworks, etc)</div>
<div>&bull; Experience in either iOS or Android Native App development</div>
<div>&bull; Experience deploying and operating apps on a modern public cloud (AWS, GCS, etc).</div>
<div>&bull; Experienced with modern software development practices (continuous integration, code reviews, git, testing, automation, &ldquo;agile-like&rdquo; practices, etc)</div>
<div>&bull; Passion for high quality software engineering. We move fast, but build polished products that are easy to maintain.</div>
<div>&bull; Passionate about aviation, transportation, and doing audacious things.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We are located in Mountain View just a couple of hundred feet from Shoreline Lake and its surrounding walking/jogging trails. We offer a comprehensive benefits package including company equity, medical, dental, vision and life insurance (company pays 100% of employee premium), unlimited time off, 10 company holidays, a 401(k) plan with 50% company matching (no vesting period), commuter assistance, and education assistance.
